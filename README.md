# Sparta Global Hwk: Authorisation

*To use this app*, either log in as **user** nelly@gmail.co.uk with **password** biscuitbiscuit or make a new user and create new posts and cheeses.

* I found it easy to add the new Cheese resource and use authentication on this.

* I researched using authorisation with Pundit but did not have enough time to research thoroughly enough. For that reason, I understand how Pundit works but struggled to implement the authorisation in my app.

* I would like to improve this by having different permissions for different types of users.
